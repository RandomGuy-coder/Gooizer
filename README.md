# Gooizer
Gooizer was Final year project of my undergrad. It is a tangible user interface which uses Computer Vision to detect changes in shape and size of brightly coloured putty to produce sound. The shape and placement of the putty controls the duration, pitch and amplitude.

It was developed using Processing and PureData.
